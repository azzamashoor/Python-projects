Basic Data Analysis Python program reads a CSV file named Data.csv, processes each record line by line, and performs basic statistical analysis on the dataset. It skips the header row, extracts each person’s name, age, and weight, and computes key descriptive statistics including the average age and weight, minimum and maximum age, the standard deviation of ages and weights, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between age and weight using functions from NumPy. Additionally, it identifies the oldest person in the dataset, and in the case of a tie, selects the one with the lowest weight. Overall, the program demonstrates file handling, list manipulation, conditional logic, accumulation patterns, and basic statistical analysis in Python.
